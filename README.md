# Unlock-Patterns
The code and output generating and validating all unlock patterns

### Validation rules
* No less than 4 vertecies may have an edge
* No vertex can be used if it has already been used
* No edge can pass over a vertex without using it if it hasn't already been used

Due to size limitations I needed to store the dataset off-site. The full dataset can be found at:
